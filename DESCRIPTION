Description: 'safir2' is an upgraded and refactored version of 'safir', which implements a stochastic individual
      based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The model takes into account individual level
      immunity and neutralizing antibody titre, as well as allowing for complex vaccine
      allocation schemes.
