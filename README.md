__safir2__ is an upgraded and refactored version of [__safir__](https://github.com/mrc-ide/safir), which implements a stochastic individual
based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The model takes into account individual level
immunity and neutralizing antibody titre, as well as allowing for complex vaccine
allocation schemes. It uses [__individual__](https://github.com/mrc-ide/individual)
to specify and run the simulation model.
